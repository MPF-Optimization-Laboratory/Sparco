DONE: Modified tools and examples according to classOp

In the problems we use opFFT. Is this the analysis or synthesis operator?
If it is the synthesis, should we use its adjoint instead? L1-magic seems
to convert the Shepp-Logan phantom using fft2.

- Update the website, split two parts of Sparco.
- Exclude the .bib file in the distribution
- Include .bib information, with citation keys


Sparco Operators
----------------

- Contributions and suggestions are welcome
- Document operators and problems
- Example tool

- Change opClass to SparcoOp
- Add methods to the class:
      * Matrices of operators
      * Find?
      * Subset indexing
- Printing of opBlockDiag, simplify if possible
- Do we want to keep counters / See if properties of
  class works for counter, op.counter / Fix bug

- Flip curvelet and surfacelet modes

- Output of webpages / operators

- opHaar(16) does not work



Sparco Problem Set
------------------
- Add problem for restricted DCT
- PROB002: Why is this problem still marked as PRELIMINARY!?
- Add problems given by Rayan
- Make parsing of the parameters faster (Sparco problems)
- tools/opDifference, this 'operator' remains a function
- Combine problems 9 and 10, with a single option to normalize
  the Heaviside matrix. 



Organization
------------
- Move all tools, etc, to a top-level private dir.
  For example, the rwt directory shouldn't clash
  with another RTW toolbox that the user already
  has installed.


Problem specific:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Problem xx: Add noise
- Problem 28: Parameters, default settings (smooth = difficult), add noise?
- Problem 62: Generalize generateAngiogram() function?
- Problem 63: Add sparsity basis, although not used in TV


Operators:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Implement non-uniform FFT operator based on nufft; implement
  Spiral FFT, or do not implement non-uniform FFT.
- Implement standard methods.
- Rename 'classOp' to 'sparcoOp'

Meeting:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Choose appropriate default settings for each problem
- Ensure validity of all problems
- Add historical problems from the basis pursuit paper?
- Numbering; 100, 200, etc?


% --- CONFIGURATION --------------------------------------------------
- Matlab requirement 7 and higher
- Curvelet does not work under Windows
- Move literature.bib to the documentation directory?
- Do we distribute the documentation directory?
- generateHTML: Output problems.html, operators.html, probXXX.html,
  let the main page (generated manually) link to those.


Adding new operators/problems
-----------------------------
- Dot test for operators
- Add "submitted-by" in info?
- Add "files" in info? (package each problem for website)


Papers that actually *use* Sparco
---------------------------------
- Fast greedy algorithms for large sparse inverse problems, Thomas
Blumensath and Mike E. Davies
